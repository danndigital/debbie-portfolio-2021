        <h2>Who am I?</h2>

        <p>
          I am a self-taught frontend developer in the UK. I'm also a yoga
          teacher and bake pretty tasty cakes (or at least thatâ€™s what people
          tell me).
        </p>

        <p>
          My background is in digital marketing for large businesses. My social
          media knowledge and experience of content creation help me to deliver
          beautiful websites with JavaScript, React and TailwindCSS.
        </p>
